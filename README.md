### 🔐 Site Security Posture

- Every page enforces a tailored Content Security Policy (CSP). If you add new external assets, update the relevant CSP meta tag to include the new host(s).
- Third-party scripts are limited to Google reCAPTCHA (for the contact form) and EmailJS (for client-side email delivery). Both are already whitelisted; remove the includes if you disable either feature.
- Project pages share a single modal/gallery script at `js/project-modal.js`, keeping inline scripts out of the HTML to satisfy CSP.
- A disclosure policy is published at `.well-known/security.txt` for coordinated vulnerability reporting.
- The EmailJS public key remains visible on the client. Rotate the key periodically and consider moving email delivery to a server-side workflow if you need stricter credential secrecy.
